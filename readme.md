<p>This a bare bones full stack, single-page Javascript web application made only with HTML + CSS + Javascript for the front end and NodeJS for the backend. The intent was to use as few frameworks as possible to avoid abstracting out any code complexity needed for development. This is meant for developing a better understanding of how full stack web applications work under the hood.</p>

## Basic setup and walkthrough

- install node modules

```
$ npm i nodemon
```

- run this script to start up the server (see package.json for any additional scripts)
```
$ npm run server
```

- open a new window/tab at `http://localhost:${portname}` in your web browser to view running app
